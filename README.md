# 3D-print-request

Program made for the McMaster Library Lyons New Media Centre to track and record 3D printing requests they get from patrons in the university. It uses python and tkinter to interface with Google spreadsheets and email in order to inform patrons of ready-to-pick-up prints and records print statuses for the Centre.
